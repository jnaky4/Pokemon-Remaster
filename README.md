# Pokemon-Remaster

This repository is our capstone project for Mizzou. It is a pokemon remaster using original, hand drawn artwork; reworked mechanics; and numerous bug fixes, balancing, and fairness upgrades. We do not have permision for anything copywrited in here, so it is for our education only. Made by Jake, Levi, and Evan. Thanks for the help, Taylor and Garrett.
